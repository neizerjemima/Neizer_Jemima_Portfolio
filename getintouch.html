                <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                <p> Before the project was kick started, research was done to evaluated and gain inspiration from what waas already on the market. An inpiration board was made both myself and project patner, decision about the logo and product packaging type was made. We both created logos individually then one was choosen and refined. For the packaging we first choose a bottle but after excution in cinema4d, we didn't this the bottle aligns well with the brand image we were going with as well as our target market. After varoius decisions were made, the tasks was shared between us with me being developer and my patner being designer. I handled everything coding about our zima website as well as the cinema4d of the project. My project patner handled the editing of the video in after effect as well as designing the agreed pencil drafted layout of our page. She also designed the logo with the agreed tweeks on Adobe Illustrator. Ithen coded the website using html,css and javascript.
